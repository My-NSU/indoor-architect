	/// a reference to the IMDF Features. One approach would be to pass the reference of the project down
	/// to every controller which ends with every controller having a project reference. When a project is selected
	/// The reference is being assigned to this property and can be used throughout the app.
	///
	/// The project reference may be nil, when no project is selected. This could be when a guide or resource is visible
	/// - Important:
	///	It is very important to make sure that this property always represents the current project selection state.
	/// Therefore the property is an implicitly unwrapped `IMDFProject`. We assume at any given time in a project
	/// context, that this property is set.
